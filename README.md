Jean and Rose BookClub

Jean&Rose is a book club founded on connecting older and younger generations in the UK. By proxy this also lends itself to fighting the loneliness pandemic too! We do this by connecting young and old through a love of reading to stimulate the mind, generate conversations and create understanding and friendship. 

When you sign up to Jean&Rose through our webpage we take a few details such as your age and then call you back to ask further questions to find out what your reading level is and your interests. We then pair you with someone of a different generation with whom we think you will connect. One of you picks a book to read, you both read it and speak over the phone once a week (or more or less regularly depending on your preference). Once the first book is finished, then the person who didn't pick the book last time, picks the book this time! 

The idea is that different generations can find it hard to find topics of conversation to have with each other and to understand each other. But through being open minded and reading the same material, different generations can find common ground, interesting topics of conversation, friendship and connection. We do ask that individuals be open to reading something that they might not have picked themselves and be willing to listen to other people's perspectives and opinions with grace. We want people to be able to voice their thoughts and opinions but know that they are doing so to an open minded audience and also be willing to hear opinions that may be very different to their own.

For open minded individuals who want to connect.

FEATURES:

Navigation bar:

The nav bar is present on all pages and has large clear icons that are easily clickable. It is fully responsive, some icons go into a dropdown menu at small screen sizes in order to keep the nav bar from taking up too much of the screen. The navigation text is accompanied by large icons in order to aid intuitive use of the website. This site is also aimed at older people as well as young people, as eye sight degeneration is more common in older people, it was important to make the site navigation as clear and obvious as possible in order to avoid cognitive fatigue. 

Even on small screens the "What is J&R?" and "Members Stories" stay visible because if it your first visit to the site you might want to have more details about J&R is about. 

The only page which does not have every navigation button available is the "sign-up" page because it seems counter-intuitive to have a button that sends you back to the page the user is already on. 

The ability to navigate between pages without using the "back" button makes for better UX and means that you can navigate to anywhere on the website with a maximum of 3 clicks.

HOMEPAGE:

Home Page Hero Image:


* On the home page there is an eye-catching image of a cosy looking library with a quote overlay. I chose the library picture as this is Heaven for people who like to read, and so should evoke a positive emotional response.
* I chose the quote over-lay because this site is aimed at people who like to read, so they are likely to have a positive emotional response to powerful wording.

How it works section:

* This section explains with the use of text and icons how J&R BookClub works. It outlines in numbered steps that are easy to follow, how to sign up and what happens once you have.
* This section should encourage the user to sign up because it shows how easy it is to do so and the benefits of doing so.
* The picture in the centre visualises the friendship and connection that may come from joining.

Back to top button:

* This button makes it easy for users to navigate back to the top of the page rather than scrolling. This is a positive user experience feature because it saves people time and makes the site more convenient to navigate, especially as this site has quite a high amount of text.

The Footer:

* The footer is very simple and just contains a tagline about the type of person that would enjoy J&R and links to social media for the bookclub. 
* The social media links open in a new tab of their corresponding sites. This encourages users to stay connected with the club via social media, but is purposefully very simple. The target audience for this site is people of different generations who would like to connect. So this means that a large proportion of the audience will be the over 65 age group. This group use the internet and social media less than any other age group so it's important to not have a huge emphasis on social media. 
* The over 65 age group are more likely to be on Facebook and Pinterest than other sites and this is why these social links have been included.
* The footer is fully responsive and is present on every page in order to show consistency which is reassuring to the user.

WHAT IS J&R PAGE

Hero image: every page contains a hero image with a quote overlay for the reasons already specified. The picture changes for each page in order to better reflect the topics of the page. 

For the "What is J&R" page, I chose a picture of two people of different generations talking and smiling together. This was to show the pleasant relationships and friendships that J&R hopes to help people create. By visually showing this to the site user they will be able to see the benefits of joining more easily. 

Cards:

* This page then goes on to talk about where the idea of J&R came from, the aim and the outcome. These are put in three seperate cards with images to illustrate what the text is describing. This helps the user to further understand the behind-the-scenes working of the J&R idea and what it aims to achieve.
* This will be valuable to the user as they will be able to gain a more in depth understand of the bookclub. It will also garner a positive emotional response from the user as the images are eyecatching and pleasant and the information is set out in an easy to read way.

Back to top button:

* This button makes it easy for users to navigate back to the top of the page rather than scrolling. This is a positive user experience feature because it saves people time and makes the site more convenient to navigate, especially as this site has quite a high amount of text.


MEMBERS STORIES PAGE:

Hero image with quote:

* This time the hero image is of a bridge, because the quote that overlays the picture talks about building bridges between different generations.
* The bridge image is pleasing to look at, calm and has a variety of green colours which work well with the sites colour palette.

Testimonial cards:

* This page contains detailed testimonials from current customers, these are useful to the user because they show the benefits of joining and convey the idea of a peer to peer recommendation from other people in the target audience.
* These are set out in cards with an associated image so that the user can easily see the person who has left the testimonial and can see that they are happy to be a part of the bookclub.
* This page is fully responsive too so the cards stack up on smaller screens. This continues to make it easy for the user to understand who the positive quotes are associated with and what people are saying about the bookclub.

Back to top button:
* This button makes it easy for users to navigate back to the top of the page rather than scrolling. This is a positive user experience feature because it saves people time and makes the site more convenient to navigate, especially as this site has quite a high amount of text.

COMBATTING LONELINESS PAGE:

Hero image with quote:

* This picture of a young and old person with their eyes close together and smiling comveys the idea that positive inter-generational relationships can have a positive emotional response.
* The quote talks about how loneliness can effect anyone, young or old and this fits with the image which brings young and old together.

Article:
* This article is broken down into three different headings helping the reader to see how the information is organised. It is in a logical order which: explains what loneliness is and why it is a problem, then goes on to describe how J&R BookClub can help, and the importance of connecting different generations.

Article images:
* The images are used to further illustrate the points made in the article. This helps the reader to visualise parts of the article and imagine them in their own life. This helps the user to also image these scenarios as helpful to their own situation or someone they might know.
* 

Safety and security page:
Image : As safety and security is not a super compelling subject for most people, the user will be reading this page out of necessity rather than for pleasure, so I have chosen a light-hearted image to make this page easier to digest.
Cards: I have chosen cards to convey the information here too because they are a pleasant way to convey information with an image that is related to the information. The information is divided logically into: online safety, in-person safety and over-the-phone safety.
There are “more info” buttons on each card too. These buttons auto-scroll the user to the corresponding part of the page where they have further details on the corresponding type of safety/security.

Form page:
Navbar: This page has a simplified nav bar without the “sign-up”, “login” or “search library” buttons. This is because if you are on the sign-up page there is no functional point in having a sign-up button that would link to the page you are currently on. Also, if you are signing up you won’t be searching the library and you can’t login. So I removed these buttons in order to keep the function of the page clear and avoid distractions for the user.
Image: As this is a simple page that is not for conveying information, but just providing the form to sign up, I decided that a background image of books was best here. This is still in keeping with the page but not distracting from the form.
Form: The form itself gathers some key details that J&R would need in order to ask further questions about the potential new member. As J&R have quite strict security and verification processes and the audience is not necessarily tech savvy I decided that this would be better as a guided over-the-phone process rather than having long complicated forms.
Submit button: This links through to a page which thanks the user for signing up and then gives them the options to return to the rest of the site if they want to  continue reading information.

FAQ page:
Images: The image on this page clearly displays the function and as it contains text there is no need to a text overlay.
Accordion: I chose this because it is a visually pleasing way to hold lots of information on the page without having an excessive amount of text, which would lead to cognitive overload for the user. 

Bugs:
The active class on the navbar does not work this is because it is a header and not a classic navbar from Bootstrap framework. I worked around this class issue by giving each icon an id. Although not ideal, the site does function well.
