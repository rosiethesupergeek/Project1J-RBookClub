  <div class="container p-4">

    <div class="row">

          <div class="card-body">
            <h5 class="card-title">The idea</h5>
            <p class="card-text">J&R stands for Jean and Rose! Jean is the name of my grandma and she is the inspiration
              for this bookclub! I live far away from my grandma and with work and life responsibilities it has become
              more difficult to visit her as often as I would like. I was always trying to think of ways to
              connect...sometimes I would find that our conversation would stall as my grandma's life was at such a
              different place than mine.</p>
            <p>Then it came to me, I could ask my grandma to pick a book and I could read it too. I thought that would
              generate conversation topics and connection. She picked a book I never would have read called "Anatomy of
              a Soldier". My grandma loves history and anything to do with soldiers as she was born during the war and
              remembers growing up in the 1940s and 50s well.</p>
            <p>My plan worked! I had a much longer conversation with my grandma than I had in a while. The book
              generated lots of conversation and I listened to lots of stories about what it was like growing up just
              after the war had ended.My grandma even ended up sending me a ration book in the post!</p>
            <p>After this lovely experience I read about what some experts are calling "The Loneliness Pandemic" in the
              UK. Covid of course made people more isolated, and communities are structured differently to how they used
              to be making it harder for people to connect. With Brexit constantly dividing generations I thought I
              should share my idea with everyone in order to bring people back together.</p>
            <p>I think different generations can learn a lot from each other and so Jean&Rose BookClub was born!</p>

            <h5 class="card-title">The aim</h5>
            <p class="card-text">J&R BookClub aims to bring different generations together and foster a sense of
              community and connection.We do this by
              connecting people through a love of reading to stimulate the mind, generate conversations
              and create understanding and friendship. We aim to:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Build friendships and connection through conversations around the books.</li>
              <li>Encourage understanding between generations: it's often difficult for different generations to
                understand each other. But at J&R we think we can learn a lot from each other. We encourage you to be
                open minded and take a chance on reading books you might not have picked yourself.</li>
              <li>Encourage empathy: through discussion of characters who are different to us we can practice seeing
                things through another lense. </li>
              <li>Understanding: Reading different genres, authors and cultures can open members to new perspectives and
                ways of understanding the world around them.</li>
              <li>Encourage learning: Books are a great source of education. Our members learn about different authors,
                cultures, and historical periods through reading and discussing books together.</li>
              <li>Keep the mind active: Reading and discussing a book can lead to lively debates and discussions, which
                can help to foster critical thinking and understanding.</li>
            </ul>

            <h5 class="card-title">The outcome</h5>
            <p class="card-text">Our members have been saying great things about J&R such as:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>"I never though a bookclub could change my life, but it has!"</li>
              <li>"I have a great friendship with my book buddy and I look forward to our chats all week!"</li>
              <li>"I had no idea I could learn so much from someone so different to me. I'm really glad I joined."</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We are delighted that our work so far has resulted in bringing people together so much. If you would like
