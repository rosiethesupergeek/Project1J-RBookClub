            "I was nervous that I would be shy and have nothing to say to the young person I was paired with, but actually the books we read generated so many questions and thoughts that conversation was easy! I've learnt a lot more about the younger generation too, we've got more in common that I ever would have thought."

                "I was feeling really isolated before I joined J&R, but now I have a person who I can discuss books with and it's made a huge difference in my life. I have really enjoyed the books that my person has shared with me, they are not titles I would have picked and they've really made me think! I'm booked on to the event in April and I'm looking forward to meeting in person."

                   I thought there was no way I could be paired with someone who was into the same things as me - I've got a very particular interest in satelites- but I ended up paired with Frank who had a whole career as a space engineer! It's been amazing to talk to him, I'm so glad I took the leap and joined! I've learnt so much from him! And not just about space engineering, but about his life and what it was like for him growing up. It's really easy to sign up and I highly recommend. They verify everyone which is very comforting to me too.

                      I'm writing this review for my grandma who joined J&R in the Summer last year. She doesn't like to go online and "faff about with internet things" so here I am! Well I cannot tell you how much good this bookclub has done for my grandma! She is paired up with a woman called Sophie and she absolutely loves her! She looks forward to their chats and she tells me which book they are reading and what they've been chatting about this week. Since my grandad passed away last year my gran had a really rough time and I was quite worried about her. She kept saying she had no purpose. This book club is great because it means my gran needs to have read her book in time for her phone call so she can plenty to say to Sophie! It's helped to structure her day and it's really nice to see her smiling again.
